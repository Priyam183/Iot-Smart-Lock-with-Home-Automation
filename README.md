# Iot-Smart-Lock-with-Home-Automation
This project allows you to use your Android SmartPhone as a key to you house.</br> 
It has Biometric Authentication using the fingerprint sensor on your phone.</br> 
It also allows you to control other devices connected to the Smart Lock.</br> 
There are two versions of the app one of them works via the Internet while the other one works over LAN Only.</br>  
The Internet version has a limitation due to which you can only change the state of the device once every 15 seconds(server side limitation as the app uses the free version of ThingSpeak).
